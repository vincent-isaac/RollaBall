# RollaBall

## Aim:

## Algorithm:

1. File -> Scene -> Select the scene -> Save as-> New folder(Scenes)-> File name (MiniGame)

2. Heirarchy -> 3D Object-> Plane 
[ Right side-> Inspector-> Change the name of plane (Name: Ground)
Transform -> Reset
Edit -> FrameSelected ]

3. Scale the ground by giving the scaling value as x=4 y=1 z=4

4. Heirarchy -> 3D Object-> Sphere
[ Right side-> Inspector-> Change the name of plane (Name: Player)
Transform -> Reset
Edit -> FrameSelected 
Transform -> Position -> y=0.5]

5. Hierarchy -> DirectionalLight
[ Inspector -> Change the color to white (255,255,255)]

6. Create a folder in project and name as Materials
[Material folder -> Create -> Material (Name: Background)
Inspector ->Surface Inputs ->BaseMAp (Choose the color)
Metallic map-> 0
Smoothness -> 0.25
Drag the Background to the plane and release the mouse

Material folder -> Create -> Material (Name: Sphere)
Inspector ->Surface Inputs ->BaseMAp (Choose the color)
Metallic map-> 0
Smoothness -> 0.75
Drag the Sphere material to the ball and release the mouse

 7. Hierarchy -> Player-> Inspector ->Add component-> Rigidbody

8. Create a new script -> Create a folder in project (Name: Scripts)
Hierarchy -> Player -> Inspector-> AddComponent-> NewScripts-> PlayerController( Click create and Add)
